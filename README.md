All - I've moved on and my current school does not use Canvas, so unfortunately, I will not be able to maintain these any longer.

UserScripts for Canvas LMS

<b>Canvas Crosslisting.user.js</b> is a very basic tool in which the user inputs the course number of the parent course and child course and then the two are crosslisted together.

<b>instructor and admin crosslisting tools.js</b> is a more robust script in which the instructor's current term courses are loaded in a dropdown menu to choose the parent course. Then the remaining courses are dynamically created and are selectable to be child courses. Finally, the instructor can rename the parent course and submit to finalize the crosslisting and renaming actions. The instructor can also choose to crosslist without renaming and rename without crosslisting. On the subaccount page, it also adds the ability for root level admins to search for a user and then perform the same tasks as an instructor.

<b> Canvas Course Event Manager </b> is a script that will allow a user to remove the dates or delete events from a course calendar. The user can select all events displayed (100 at a time) or select specific events.

<b> Canvas Remove Student Tool </b> is a script that will allow an admin to remove students from courses in bulk. The table is sortable by name or last activity date. The "Add More" button will load the next 100 students. It is useful for managing manually created course enrollments for clubs, activities, and special courses.

<b> Print Canvas Quizzes </b> is a script that will allow a user to print a quiz from the preview page.

  <ol type="A">

    </ul>
  </ol>
  <li>Limitations</li>
  <ol type="A">

    <li>Not usable in the Quizzez.next LTI</li>
  </ol>
  </ol>
  
  <b>Remove Color Overlay</b> is a script that removes the color overlay of courses with course images on the Dashboard. This is a workaround since admin is unable to set the default Dashboard experience for users.

  <b>Acess Catalog</b> acesscatalog.user.js is a script to remove the "Non-CMS staff account" popups.
